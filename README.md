Some important commands for "R" &amp; "RStudio"
I decided to create this open source documents in English after my internship at IRD (Institue of Development and Research) in New Caledonia. Many scientists and mathematicians use "R" and more "RStudio", without a regular practice many notions are lost, so this is why I leave a record of my bases here that you and me can complete in the future.
